        <description>Quite famous, although somewhat antique bolt-action rifle, sports great accuracy and power at the cost of more than average recoil, but nothing you wouldn't handle. Was designed by an successful outlander gunsmith on a rimworld of Thalea, who then came off world to sell the design to one of the sides of the Burning Star conflict, an event which started interplanetary war for resources in the system with a collapsing sun. Yes, this story was absolutely necessary to persuade you that this rifle can handle overheat really well.Also it is very cheap.</description>
