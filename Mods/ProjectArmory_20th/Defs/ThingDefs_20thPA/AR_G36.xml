        <description>Experimental, and partially successful assault rifle utilizing caseless ammunition without sources of energy, unlike the renowned charge rifle. It is more often kept as a curiosity rather than a practical weapon, for ammunition manufacturing process is much more complicated than that of a regular cased ammunition, and considering the severe competition from charge rifles, this concept realistically only took off on underdeveloped and very faraway worlds on which metal is a very precious resource that cannot be spent on making cases.</description>
